## Reporting projects

All the projects in the Musa website were carefully processed by [a content filter tweaked to be on the safe side]. However, the filter is not perfect. If you find a project that you think should be removed, you can report it by opening a new issue on the repository describing the project and the reason you reported, if necessary. There is a [project reporting template]() avaliable on the issues page.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can copy the project text using the copy button in the top right corner of the card.

The following categories of contents (borrowed from [OpenAI's Content policy](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines/content-policy)). Any project in one of these categories will be removed from the repository.

This list is not exhaustive. If you see a project that you think should be removed for some reason, please let us know!
