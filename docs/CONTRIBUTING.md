## Reporting projects

If you found a project that you think is potentially harmful in some way and should be removed, you can report it by opening a new issue on the repository describing the project and the reason why it was reported, if necessary. There is a [project reporting template]() avaliable on the issues page.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can copy the project text using the copy button in the top right corner of the card.

The following categories of content (borrowed from [OpenAI's Content policy](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines/content-policy)) aren't permitted. If you see a project that incites any of these categories, please report it so it can be removed from the website.
